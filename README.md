# Overview

This is the repository for a class I took at Carnegie Mellon University titled Programming Usable Interfaces. The class provided a robust and in-depth introduction to user interfaces and user experiences. The lab section taught HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Final project

My final project was an interactive introduction to machine learning. The guide canvasses machine learning at a high-level, providing a definition and example for the main machine learning training models and algorithms.
