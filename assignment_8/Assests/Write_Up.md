# Website overview

My website presents a brief overview of machine learning through a visual representation using a hierarchical tree  diagram. By clicking on the nodes of the tree, information about the machine learning concept is displayed below the diagram. 

The target audience are users who have very little understanding of what machine learning is and the elements that compose it. The website engages users by having them click on the tree nodes in order to learn more about the concept the node represents. As the tree expands, users get a holistic understanding of machine learning.  


# User interaction 

- Users click on nodes to expand them and learn the ideas associated with that concept. 

To reproduce the interaction, click on all the nodes that appear as the tree diagram expands. The final nodes, which are icons related to the concept do not expand. That is the end of the tree for that section.


# External tool used

- D3.JS
- I chose to use D3.JS because it had the kind of functionality I wanted to implement from my high-fidelity mockup.  
- I used the collapsible tree functionality to represent the main elements involved in machine learning.   
- The D3.JS library adds interactivity to my site.

# Iteration from HW7

I iterated from HW7 by showing my high-fidelity mock up to some potential users and getting their feedback. They commented that the text that displays when a node is clicked seems out of place and recommended placing it under the tree as opposed to the right of it. 

Those users also mentioned that the navigation bar should have the icons on the left and not the right. I incorporated that feedback into my final site design too.

# Challenges faced

Never using the D3.JS library before, I watched a lot of YouTube videos and a Lynda course on how D3 works and how to implement the svg diagrams I wanted. 

I spent a lot of time on Stack Overflow debugging issues and finding solutions to my problems.
